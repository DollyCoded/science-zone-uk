# 🔢 Understanding the Modulo Operator in Python

Hi there! Today, we're going to learn about something called the **modulo operator**. It's a fancy name, but don't worry — it's super easy to understand. Let's jump in! 🚀

## ✨ What is the Modulo Operator?

The modulo operator in Python is written as **`%`**. It tells you what’s left over when you divide one number by another.

### Example:
- **10 / 5 = 2** (10 divided by 5 gives 2, no remainders)
- **10 % 5 = 0** (Because there are NO remainders)  
  
- **10 / 3 = 3** (10 divided by 3 gives 3, remainder 1)  
- **10 % 3 = 1** (The remainder is 1)

### Activity: Is the Number Even or Odd?

In this activity, we’ll use the modulo operator to check if a number is even or odd.

### The Code:

```python
# Which number do you want to check?
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Write your code below this line 👇


```

### How It Works:
1. **`number % 2`** checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
2. If the remainder is `0`, the number is **even**.
3. If the remainder is NOT `0`, the number is **odd**.

## ✏️ Practice Questions

1. What is **15 % 4**?
2. What is **20 % 6**?
3. What is **8 % 2**?

Check your answers by running the calculations in Python!

## 💡 Why Is Modulo Useful?

- **Finding Remainders:** Great for working with numbers.
- **Even or Odd Numbers:** Use `% 2` to check if a number is even or odd.
- **Cycles:** Modulo is used to make things repeat (like a clock that wraps from 12 back to 1).

## 🏆 Challenge Yourself!

1. Modify the code to check if a number is divisible by **3**.
2. Write a program that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 20.
3. Can you use the modulo operator to make a countdown timer that wraps back to 10 when it reaches 0?
