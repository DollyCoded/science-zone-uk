## Workshop Activities

### 1. **True Love Generator**
   - Our first activity is the **True Love Generator**. In this fun program, we calculate a "Love Score" between two names by counting specific letters and applying conditional statements.
   - This activity covers:
     - **String Manipulation**: Using functions like `lower()` and `count()` to analyze text.
     - **Combining Values**: Creating a two-digit number from the counts of certain letters.
     - **Conditional Statements**: Displaying different messages based on the "Love Score."
   - This playful project teaches you how to process data, manipulate strings, and apply conditional logic to produce varied results based on user input.

### 2. **Introduction to the `random` Module**
   - In this section, we’ll dive into the basics of Python’s `random` module, which provides functions for generating pseudo-random numbers and random selections.
   - You’ll learn about essential functions such as:
     - **`randint()`**: Generates a random integer within a specified range.
     - **`choice()`**: Randomly selects an item from a list.
     - **`random()`**: Generates a random float between 0.0 and 1.0.
     - **`shuffle()`**: Randomizes the order of items in a list.
   - This section sets the foundation for our other activities, allowing you to see how randomness can bring unpredictability and fun to your code.

### 3. **Heads or Tails Game**
   - Next, we’ll create a simple **Heads or Tails** game where a random number determines if the result is "Heads" or "Tails." This activity introduces the concept of random selection, using `randint()` to produce either outcome.

### 4. **Random Bill Payer**
   - In this real-world-inspired activity, we’ll simulate a group of friends putting their cards in a hat to randomly decide who pays the bill. By using the `choice()` function, we’ll select one friend from a list to cover the cost, demonstrating random selection in a group setting.

### 5. **Dice Roll Simulator**
   - We’ll create a dice-rolling simulator that randomly generates a number between 1 and 6, just like rolling a real six-sided die. This activity illustrates how randomness can simulate objects and scenarios in games, introducing basic probability concepts.

### 6. **Challenge Extensions and Fun Additions**
   - Finally, we’ll offer some optional challenges for further practice:
     - **Random Dice Game**: Extend the dice roll simulator to roll two dice and add their values.
     - **Mystery Number Guessing Game**: Create a guessing game where the computer generates a random number and provides hints as the player tries to guess it.

### Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, you’ll have experience creating interactive programs using randomness and essential programming concepts like conditionals, string manipulation, and loops. You’ll see how randomness adds fun and unpredictability to coding projects, equipping you with skills that extend beyond this workshop!
