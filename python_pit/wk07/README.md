# Week 7: Introduction to Libraries (Turtle)

## Objectives:
- Learn how to import and use external libraries in Python.
- Use the Turtle library to create graphics and simple animations.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Libraries**: Pre-written code that you can import and use in your program, like Turtle, to avoid reinventing the wheel.
   ```python
   import turtle
   ```
2. **Turtle**: A graphics library that lets you control a virtual "turtle" to draw shapes and patterns on the screen.
   - **Basic Commands**:
     ```python
     turtle.forward(100)  # Moves the turtle forward 100 units
     turtle.right(90)  # Turns the turtle right by 90 degrees
     ```
   - **Drawing Shapes**: You can combine movement commands to draw shapes like squares or triangles.

## Tasks:
1. Create a Turtle program that draws different shapes or patterns.
2. Write a program that uses Turtle to create a mini-game where the user controls the turtle with keyboard input.
