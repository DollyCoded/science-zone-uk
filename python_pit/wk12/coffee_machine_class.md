# üê¢ Saturday Python Lesson Plan

## üî• Starter Activity: "Code Your Week"

Use **functions**, **lists**, and **dictionaries** to model the days of your week.

---

### üü¢ Easy ‚Äì "List Your Week"
**Goal**: Use a list and a for loop to print your weekly plan.

```python
week = #create a list [] of week days "Monday","Tuesday",.....

for day in week:
    print("???")
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Extension**: Add an activity list for each day and print both.

---

### üü° Medium ‚Äì "Weekly Schedule with Dictionary"
**Goal**: Use a dictionary to store your week with one activity per day, finish off the program.

```python
#Complete the dictionary
week = {
    "Monday": "Maths",
    "Tuesday": "Science",
    "Wednesday": "???",
    "????": "????",
   
}

for day, activity in week.items():
    print(day,activity) #Improve the print statement
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Extension**: Put the loop in a function, pass in the dict as a parameter, then call the function:

```python
def show_week(?????):
    for day, activity in ?????.items():
        print(f"{day}: {activity}")
```

---

### üî¥ Hard ‚Äì "Custom Week Planner"
**Goal**: Let the user input their own week using a loop and a dictionary.

```python
my_week = {}

for _ in range(7):
    day = input("?????")
    activity = input(f"What do you do on {day}? ")
    my_week[day] = activity

#Add the same function as in the medium activity and call it
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Extension**: Turn the input into a function and let them save multiple weeks!

## üé® Activity 1: Random Walker

### üë£ Step-by-step Modelling:
Import the correct libraries
```python
import turtle as t
import random
```
initiate the class object(oops)
```python
tim = t.Turtle()
```
Initialise the variables
```python
colours = ["CornflowerBlue", "DarkOrchid", "IndianRed", "DeepSkyBlue"]
directions = [0, 90, 180, 270]
```
Set up turtle parameters
```python
tim.pensize(15)
tim.speed("fastest")
```
Run a loop to draw 100 iterations
```python
for _ in range(100):
    tim.color(random.choice(colours))
    tim.forward(30)
    tim.setheading(random.choice(directions))
```

---

### ‚ú® Extension: Many Walkers

```python
walkers = []

for _ in range(10):
    new_turtle = t.Turtle()
    new_turtle.pensize(10)
    new_turtle.speed("fastest")
    walkers.append(new_turtle)

for _ in range(100):
    for walker in walkers:
        walker.color(random.choice(colours))
        walker.forward(20)
        walker.setheading(random.choice(directions))
```

---

## ‚òï Activity 2: Coffee Machine
You need to save the class CoffeeMachine.py into a folder to be able to use it. 

### ‚òï CoffeeMachine Class Documentation

The `CoffeeMachine` class simulates a real coffee vending machine. You can use it in your own Python programs to build a coffee shop simulation.

---

### üì¶ What the Class Can Do

### `coffee_machine.print_menu()`
Shows a list of drinks and prices.

**Example:**
```python
coffee_machine.print_menu()
```

---

### `coffee_machine.check_resources(drink)`
Checks if there are enough ingredients to make the drink.

**Returns**: `True` or `False`

**Example:**
```python
if coffee_machine.check_resources("latte"):
    print("We can make your coffee!")
```

---

### `coffee_machine.process_payment(cost)`
Asks the user to insert coins and checks if it‚Äôs enough.

**Returns**: `True` if enough money was given

**Example:**
```python
if coffee_machine.process_payment(2.5):
    print("Payment accepted!")
```

---

### `coffee_machine.make_coffee(drink)`
Makes the coffee and updates the machine's ingredients.

**Example:**
```python
coffee_machine.make_coffee("mocha")
```

---


Use the provided `CoffeeMachine` class.  Write a program that **uses** it.

```python
from coffee_machine import CoffeeMachine

# Step 1: Make your machine

# Step 2: Show the menu

# Step 3: Ask the user

# Step 4: Check ingredients and payment
        # if resources then get price
            #if processed payment then make coffee
```

## üéØ Bonus Challenges

- Make the program **loop** so it keeps asking for drinks
- Let the user type `"off"` to turn the machine off
- Show a `"report"` that tells how much water, milk, and coffee are left


---

## üé® Plenary: Make More Art

Ask: "Can code be art?"

Ideas:
- Rainbow spirals
- Circles on circles
- Trails that never lift
- Use `random` for colors, size, or angles
