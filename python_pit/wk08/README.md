# Week 8: Final Project

## Objectives:
- Apply everything learned to create a final Python project.
- Present the final project to the class.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Integration**: Combining all previous concepts—variables, loops, conditionals, functions, file handling, and Turtle—into one program.
2. **Final Project**: A complete Python program that demonstrates your skills in problem-solving, creativity, and technical implementation.

## Tasks:
1. Build a final project such as a text-based game, a mini app, or a creative Turtle project.
2. Present your final project to your classmates, explaining the code and how it works.
