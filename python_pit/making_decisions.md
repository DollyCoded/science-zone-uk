# Making Decisions with Code

Welcome to your coding adventure! 🎉 Today, we’ll explore decision-making in Python using Boolean values, variables, and comparisons. Ready to start? Let’s dive in!

---

## 🛠 What You'll Need:
- A computer or laptop.
- Python installed or use an online IDE like [Replit](https://replit.com/).

---

## 🧑‍💻 What You'll Learn:
1. **Boolean Values**: True or False decisions.
2. **Variables**: Storing and comparing data.
3. **Logical Operators**: Combining conditions.
4. **Interactive Challenges**.

---

## 🚀 Lesson Steps

### 1️⃣ Boolean Values: True or False
Computers make decisions by asking questions with answers that are either `True` or `False`. These are called Boolean values.

**Example:**
```python
is_raining = True
has_done_homework = False

print("Is it raining?", is_raining)
print("Have you done your homework?", has_done_homework)
```

Run this code to see how Boolean values work.

#### 🏆 Challenge:
Create two variables: `likes_pineapple` and `is_tired`. Set them to `True` or `False`. Then print both variables.

---

### 2️⃣ Variables and Comparisons
Variables store information. We can compare variables to make decisions.

**Example:**
```python
age = 12
if age > 10:
    print("You are older than 10.")
else:
    print("You are 10 or younger.")
```

#### 🏆 Challenge:
Write a program that compares your favorite number to 7. Print "It’s bigger than 7" or "It’s smaller than 7" based on the comparison.

---

### 3️⃣ Logical Operators: Combining Conditions
We use `and` and `or` to combine multiple comparisons.

**Example:**
```python
pineapples = 5
zebras = 2

if pineapples > zebras and zebras > 0:
    print("There are more pineapples than zebras, and zebras exist!")
```

#### 🏆 Challenge:
Create a program that:
1. Checks if you have more apples than bananas.
2. Prints "I have more apples!" if true, or "I have more bananas!" otherwise.
3. Use `and` or `or` to add an extra condition.

---

## 🌟 Extra Challenges

### 🧠 Challenge 1: Pineapples and Zebras
Use the variables `pineapples = 5` and `zebras = 2`. Write code to:
- Check if the number of pineapples equals zebras.
- Check if there are more zebras than pineapples.

### 🧠 Challenge 2: Favorite Activity
Write a program that:
1. Asks the user for their favorite activity and their energy level (1-10).
2. Prints "You’re ready for [activity]!" if energy is greater than 5.

### 🧠 Challenge 3: Multiple Conditions
Write a program to check if:
1. You have 3 or more pets.
2. You like dogs (`likes_dogs = True`).
3. Print "You’re an animal lover!" if both conditions are true.

---

## 🏁 Wrapping Up
### ✅ What You’ve Learned:
- Boolean values (`True` and `False`).
- Comparing variables with `==`, `!=`, `<`, and `>`.
- Combining conditions using `and` and `or`.

### 🎯 Next Steps:
Show your teacher or a friend your best challenge solution. Then, think about how you could use this knowledge to create a game or solve a problem!
