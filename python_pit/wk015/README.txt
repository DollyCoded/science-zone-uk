# Python Workshop: Variables and Math Operations 🐍

Welcome to the Python Workshop! 🎉 Today, we’ll learn how to use variables and perform math operations in Python. Open your **Thonny** editor and follow along with the steps below. Let’s get started! 🚀

---

## What You’ll Learn 🧠
1. What variables are and how to use them.
2. How to do math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in Python.
3. How to combine variables with math operations.

---

## Step 1: What is a Variable?
A **variable** is like a container that holds information. You can give it a name and store something in it, like a number or a word.

### Example:
```python
my_variable = 10
print(my_variable)  # This will print: 10

Step 2: Create Your First Variable

    Open Thonny.
    Write the following code:

favourite_number = 7
print("My favourite number is:", favourite_number)

    Run your program and see what it prints.

Step 3: Do Some Math

You can use variables to do math operations. Let’s try addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Example:

a = 10
b = 5

# Addition
print("Addition:", a + b)

# Subtraction
print("Subtraction:", a - b)

# Multiplication
print("Multiplication:", a * b)

# Division
print("Division:", a / b)

What to Do:

    Copy the example into Thonny.
    Change the values of a and b to your own numbers.
    Run the program and see the results.

Step 4: Combine Math with Variables

Let’s combine math operations with variables.
Task:

    Write a program that calculates the total of three items you buy from a shop.
    Store the prices of the items in variables.
    Calculate the total and print the result.

Example:

item1 = 2.50
item2 = 1.75
item3 = 3.00

total = item1 + item2 + item3
print("The total cost is:", total)

Step 5: Challenge Yourself! 🚀

    Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle.
        Use variables length and width to store the dimensions.
        Multiply them to get the area and print the result.

Example:

length = 5
width = 3

area = length * width
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)

    Try creating your own math problem and solve it using variables!

Great job completing the workshop! 🎉 You’ve learned how to use variables and perform math operations in Python. Keep practicing, and have fun coding! 🐍
