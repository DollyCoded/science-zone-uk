# 🐍 Python Fun Starter Template 🌟

Welcome, young coder! 🎉 This is your Python starter program. Follow this guide to complete your program step by step and create something amazing! 🚀

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Imports 📚

Sometimes, Python needs special tools to do cool things like math, timekeeping, or random numbers. These tools are called "libraries." 

### Your Mission:
1. Add your imports at the top of your program.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from datetime import datetime
     from random import randint
     ```

---

## Step 2: Create Some Variables 🌍

Variables are like boxes where Python stores things for you. Let's create a few fun ones!

### Your Mission:
1. Add these variables under the `# variables` section:
   ```python
   world = '🌍🌎🌏'
   python = 'Python 🐍'
   fire = '🔥'
   ```

2. Print your variables to the screen to see what they look like:
   ```python
   print(f"Hello {world}")
   print(f"Welcome to {python}")
   ```

---

## Step 3: Write a Function ✨

Functions are reusable bits of code. They help you organize your program and make it easier to read.

### Your Mission:
1. Write a function under the `# Function definitions` section.
   - Example: A function to roll a dice.
     ```python
     def roll_dice():
         sides = input("How many sides does your dice have? ")
         roll = randint(1, int(sides))
         print(f"You rolled a {roll} {'🔥' * roll}")
     ```

2. Call your function under the `# Put code to run under here` section:
   ```python
   roll_dice()
   ```

---

## Step 4: Add More Fun! 🎉

Make your program unique by adding:
- Emojis 🎨
  ```python
  print("I ❤️ Python!")
  print("Coding makes me 😃")
  print(f"I want to make 🌈 projects with {python}")
  ```

- A cool math trick ➕✖️
  ```python
  print(111111111 * 111111111)
  ```

- The current date and time 🕒
  ```python
  print(f"The date and time is {datetime.now()}")
  ```

---

## Step 5: Run Your Code 🏃‍♂️

1. Save your file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `python_fun.py`).
2. Open your terminal or code editor.
3. Run the program and watch the magic happen! 🎆

---

## Bonus Challenge 🌟

Can you:
- Add your own function? (Maybe a "Hello" function that greets someone by name?)
- Change the emoji to your favorites?
- Make the dice roller roll two dice and add their results?

Great job, coder! 🙌 You've built a fantastic program. Keep exploring, keep learning, and most importantly, have fun! 🦄🚀
