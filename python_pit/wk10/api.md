[Carbon Intensity API](https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/intensity)   
National Energy System Operator (NESO), in partnership with Environmental Defense Fund Europe, University of Oxford Department of Computer Science and WWF, have developed the world's first Carbon Intensity forecast with a regional breakdown.
The Carbon Intensity API uses state-of-the-art Machine Learning and sophisticated power system modelling to forecast the carbon intensity and generation mix 96+ hours ahead for each region in Great Britain.
Our OpenAPI allows consumers and smart devices to schedule and minimise COz emissions at a local level.
