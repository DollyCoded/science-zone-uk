# Python Workshop: Get Started with Coding! üéâ

Hello, young coder! In this workshop, we‚Äôll explore some fun Python basics. You‚Äôll learn how to display messages on the screen, ask questions, and create your own stories or jokes using code!

## What You‚Äôll Learn
- **Print statements** to show text on the screen.
- **Inputs** to let people type in answers.
- **String Manipulation** to create fun messages.
- **Concatenation** to join text together.

### Saving Your Work

Each time you create a new program, **save it with a new file name**. For example, after Step 1, you might name your file `hello_world.py`. After Step 2, save it as `multi_line_story.py`, and so on. By the end of this workshop, you should have **6 different Python programs**!

### Step 1: Saying Hello to Python

1. **Open your Python editor** or use an online editor (like Replit or Thonny).
2. Type this code to make your computer say `"Hello, World!"`:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
3. **Run the code** (usually a ‚ÄúRun‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button) to see the message on the screen.

**What‚Äôs Happening?**
- The `print` function tells the computer to show whatever‚Äôs inside the quotes.

### Step 2: Making Multi-Line Messages

1. Let‚Äôs create a fun story across multiple lines. Try this code:
   ```python
   print("Once upon a time...\nA cat sat on a mat.\nThe cat had a hat.\nAnd that was that!")
   ```
2. **Notice the `\n`?** This little trick tells Python to move to a new line.

**Challenge:** Change the story! Add new lines or make it rhyme.

### Step 3: Ask for Their Name and Favourite Animal

1. Now, let‚Äôs make your code more personal. We‚Äôll ask for someone‚Äôs name and their favourite animal.
   ```python
   name = input("What's your name? ")
   animal = input("What's your favorite animal? ")
   print("Hello " + name + "! Did you know " + animal + "s are awesome?")
   ```
2. Run it! Type in a name and an animal to see the custom message.

**What‚Äôs Happening?**
- `input` lets people type in answers.
- The `+` symbol joins words together.

---

### Step 4: Adding Line Breaks with `\n` for Fun Messages

1. Use `\n` to make a multi-line message that says something fun about the favourite animal.
   ```python
   print("Hello " + name + "!\nGuess what?\nI saw a " + animal + " today!\nIt was so cool!")
   ```
2. Experiment by adding more `\n` to create your own line breaks.

### Step 5: Create a Silly Sentence with More Input

1. Let‚Äôs make a silly sentence where we combine different words.
   ```python
   food = input("Name a food: ")
   place = input("Name a place: ")
   print("I love eating " + food + " when I'm at " + place + "!\nIt's the best!")
   ```
2. Try running this and see how you can create your own funny sentences.

### Step 6: Final Project - Write a Poem or Story!

1. Use everything you've learned to create a story or poem. Ask for three lines to build a custom poem!
   ```python
   line1 = input("Enter the first line of your poem: ")
   line2 = input("Enter the second line of your poem: ")
   line3 = input("Enter the third line of your poem: ")
   print(line1 + "\n" + line2 + "\n" + line3)
   ```
2. **Challenge**: Create your own multi-line story, joke, or poem!

Congratulations on completing the workshop! By now, you should have **6 different Python programs** saved with unique names. Keep exploring and creating with Python.
