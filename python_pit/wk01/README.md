# Week 1: Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax

## Objectives:
- Understand the basics of Python programming.
- Learn how to write Python programs that use variables and user input.
- Get familiar with Python syntax and running scripts.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Python**: A high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Used in many fields such as web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
2. **Variable**: A way to store information in a program, like a container. For example, `age = 12` stores the value `12` in a variable named `age`.
3. **Data Types**: The kinds of values a variable can hold. Examples:
   - `int`: Integer numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 100)
   - `str`: Strings (text) (e.g., "Hello", "Python")
   - `float`: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
4. **Input/Output**: The `input()` function takes data from the user, while `print()` outputs data to the screen.
   - Example: `name = input("What is your name?")` will store the user’s name in the `name` variable.
5. **Basic Syntax**: Refers to how Python code should be written. For example, Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.

## Tasks:
1. Write a Python program that introduces itself and asks the user a few questions like their name or favourite colour.
2. Modify the program to respond based on the user’s input.
