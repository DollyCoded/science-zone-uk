# Week 1 Pseudocode and Idea Development Guide

## What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is a way to plan out your program using simple, plain language instead of actual code. It helps you break down the steps of what your program will do before you write it in Python.

## Why is Pseudocode Important?
- Helps you organise your thoughts
- Makes coding easier because you already have a plan
- Lets you focus on solving the problem without worrying about the exact syntax

## How to Write Pseudocode
1. **Start with the Big Picture**: What does your program need to do? Think about it in simple steps.
2. **Break it Down**: What smaller steps are needed to achieve the goal? Each part of your pseudocode should match a part of your final program.
3. **Be Clear and Simple**: Use simple sentences like "Ask the user for their name" or "Check if the number is greater than 10".
4. **Don't Worry About Code Yet**: You don't need to know Python syntax to write pseudocode. Just focus on what the program does.

## Example: Pseudocode for a Simple Q&A Program

### Goal:
Create a program that asks the user three questions and gives responses based on their answers.

### Pseudocode:
1. Print a message to greet the user
2. Ask the user for their name
3. Ask the user for their favorite color
4. Ask the user for their favorite food
5. Respond to each answer in a fun way
6. Print a final message with all of their answers

### Code Development:
Once you have the pseudocode, you can start turning it into real Python code. Here’s how the above pseudocode translates into Python:

```python
# Step 1: Print a greeting
print("Hello! Let's get to know each other.")

# Step 2: Ask for the user's name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Step 3: Ask for the user's favorite color
color = input("What's your favorite color, " + name + "? ")

# Step 4: Ask for the user's favorite food
food = input("What's your favorite food? ")

# Step 5: Respond to their answers
print(color + " is a great color!")
print("Yum! I love " + food + " too!")

# Step 6: Print a final message
print("Thanks for chatting, " + name + "!")
```

## Your Turn!
Now, think of a new idea for a program and write down the pseudocode before you start coding. Here’s a simple template you can follow:

### My Program Idea:
Write what your program will do in one sentence.

### Pseudocode:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Once you have your pseudocode, go ahead and try turning it into a real Python program! Have fun coding!
