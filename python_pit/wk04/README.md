# Week 4: Lists and Arrays

## Objectives:
- Understand how to use lists to store multiple pieces of data.
- Learn how to access, update, and manipulate data in lists.

## Key Concepts:
1. **List**: A collection of items in Python, which can hold multiple values. Lists are ordered and changeable, allowing you to store data like a playlist of songs.
   ```python
   my_list = ["song1", "song2", "song3"]
   ```
2. **Indexing**: Accessing elements in a list by their position. Python uses zero-based indexing.
   ```python
   print(my_list[0])  # Outputs 'song1'
   ```
3. **Appending and Removing**: Adding and removing elements from a list.
   ```python
   my_list.append("song4")
   my_list.remove("song1")
   ```

## Tasks:
1. Write a program to manage a playlist, allowing users to add, view, and delete songs.
2. Create a shopping list manager where users can add and remove items from a list.
