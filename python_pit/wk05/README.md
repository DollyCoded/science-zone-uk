# Week 5: Functions and Modular Programming

## Objectives:
- Understand how to create functions to organize and reuse code.
- Break down a program into smaller, manageable parts using functions.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help avoid repetition and make code more modular.
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       print(f"Hello, {name}")
   greet("Alice")
   ```
2. **Parameters and Return Values**: Parameters allow you to pass information into functions, while return values allow functions to give information back.
   ```python
   def add(a, b):
       return a + b
   ```
3. **Modular Programming**: The practice of breaking down a program into small, reusable parts (functions) to make code more readable and maintainable.

## Tasks:
1. Create a program to calculate students' grades using functions.
2. Build a virtual pet program where different functions manage pet actions like feeding, playing, and resting.
