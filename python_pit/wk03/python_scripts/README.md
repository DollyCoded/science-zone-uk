# Week 3 Pseudocode and Idea Development Guide

## Pseudocode for Loops and Repetition

### What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is used to plan your code before you write it, using plain English to make it easy to understand. This week's focus is on loops, and how we get our code to do things more than once.

## Why is Pseudocode Important?
- Helps you figure out what parts of the code you can repeat
- Makes it easier to understand what's happening in your program
- Allows others to easily collaborate on your code without needing to understand exact syntax.

## How to Write Pseudocode for Loops and Repetition
1. **Identify what can be repeated**: What parts of your program can be written in a loop
2. **Find how many times to loop**: Will your code need to repeat for a set number of times, infinitely, or while a condition is true?
3. **Write what needs to be repeated**: Write your functionality inside your loop

## Example: Pseudocode for a Higher or Lower Game

### Goal:
Create a program that generates a number, and the user has to guess it. The computer says whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.

### Pseudocode:
1. Print a message to greet the user
2. Generate a random number
3. While the user hasn't guessed the number:
4. Ask the user for a number
5. Print higher or lower depending on the guess
6. When they've guessed it, launch a rocket using a countdown

## Your Turn!
Now, think of a new idea for a program and write down the pseudocode before you start coding. Hereâ€™s a simple template you can follow:

### My Program Idea:
Write what your program will do in one sentence.

### Pseudocode:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Once you have your pseudocode, go ahead and try turning it into a real Python program! Have fun coding!
