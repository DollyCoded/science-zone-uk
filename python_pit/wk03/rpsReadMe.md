### The Basic Rules of RPS

Despite its underlying complexity, the gameâ€™s rules are straightforward. 
Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, with 
the outcome determined by these three rules:

```text
    Rock wins against scissors.
    Scissors win against paper.
    Paper wins against rock.
```

1. Import necessary libraries
    - Import `random` for the computer's choice

2. Define ASCII art for gestures
    - Store each ASCII art (e.g., rock, paper, scissors) in a variable
    -  each variable should be a gesture name (e.g., "rock", "paper", "scissors")
    - Make a list of the variable names

3. Create a function to display the game rules
    - Print the rules for the player

4. Create a function to get the player's choice
    - Prompt the player to choose "rock", "paper", or "scissors"
    - Validate the input to ensure it is one of the valid choices
    - Return the player's choice

5. Create a function to get the computer's choice
    - Use `random.choice()` to select between "rock", "paper", or "scissors"
    - Return the computer's choice

6. Create a function to determine the winner
    - Accept the player's choice and the computer's choice as arguments
    - Compare the choices using the rules of the game:
        - Rock beats Scissors
        - Scissors beats Paper
        - Paper beats Rock
    - Return "Player wins", "Computer wins", or "Tie"

7. Create the main game loop
    - Display the game rules
    - Get the player's choice
    - Get the computer's choice
    - Display the ASCII art for both choices
    - Determine the winner
    - Print the result

8. Ask the player if they want to play again
    - If yes, repeat the game loop
    - If no, exit the game

9. End the program
