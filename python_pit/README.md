# Python Pit 8-Week Program

## Overview

Welcome to the **Python Pit** 8-week coding program! This program is designed to progressively teach Python programming concepts through hands-on activities and challenges. Each week focuses on specific topics, helping learners build their Python skills with practical examples, challenges, and pseudocode exercises.

The program is structured to cover key Python concepts from basic syntax to advanced problem-solving techniques. By the end of the 8 weeks, participants will have a strong understanding of Python programming and be able to apply it to various projects.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into weekly folders (`wk01`, `wk02`, ..., `wk08`), each representing one week of the program. Inside each folder, you'll find the following content:

```
.
├── readme_files                 # Contains README templates for each week
├── wk01 - wk08                  # Folders for each week of the program
│   ├── python_scripts           # Contains Python scripts and challenges for each week
│   │   ├── activity.py          # Main activity for the week
│   │   ├── advanced_challenge.py# Advanced challenge for those who want to go further
│   │   ├── challenge.py         # Additional challenge for skill enhancement
│   └── README.md                # Overview of the week's objectives and content
