# Week 2 Pseudocode and Idea Development Guide

## Pseudocode for Conditional Logic

### What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is a simple way of planning your program using plain language. This week, we focus on conditional logic (if-elif-else statements) to make decisions in your programs.

## Why is Pseudocode Important?
- Helps you think through decision-making processes before coding
- Makes it easier to plan out complex logic
- Allows you to focus on problem-solving

## How to Write Pseudocode for Conditionals:
1. **Identify the decision**: What choices will the program make? (e.g., If the user is younger than 13, suggest an activity for kids)
2. **Write the condition**: For each choice, write a condition that will trigger the right decision (e.g., if age < 13).
3. **Plan the response**: Describe what the program should do in each case (e.g., suggest going to the park).

## Example: Pseudocode for Activity Suggestion

### Goal:
Suggest an activity based on the user's age and favorite season.

### Pseudocode:
1. Ask for the user's age
2. Ask for the user's favorite season
3. If the user is younger than 13 and it's summer, suggest building a sandcastle
4. If the user is younger than 13 and it's winter, suggest having a snowball fight
5. If the user is between 13 and 18 and it's summer, suggest going to the beach
6. If the user is between 13 and 18 and it's winter, suggest snowboarding
7. If the user is older than 18, suggest hiking in summer or reading in winter
8. Print a final message to wish them fun

## Your Turn:
Now, try to come up with your own pseudocode for a new program! Write down the conditions and decisions before starting to code.

### My Program Idea:
Write what your program will do in one sentence.

### Pseudocode:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Once you have your pseudocode, try turning it into a real Python program!
