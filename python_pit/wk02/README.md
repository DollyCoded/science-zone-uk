# Week 2: Conditional Statements and Logic

## Objectives:
- Learn how to use conditional statements to make decisions in Python.
- Apply logic to solve problems using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Conditional Statements**: These allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions.
   - **if statement**: Checks if a condition is true and runs a block of code if it is.
     ```python
     if age >= 18:
         print("You can vote!")
     ```
   - **elif statement**: Checks another condition if the previous condition is false.
   - **else statement**: Runs if none of the previous conditions are true.
2. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values in conditions. Common operators:
   - `==`: Equals
   - `!=`: Not equals
   - `>`: Greater than
   - `<`: Less than
   - `>=`: Greater than or equal to
   - `<=`: Less than or equal to
3. **Boolean Logic**: Python expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. Often used with conditionals.

## Tasks:
1. Create a Python program that recommends an activity based on the weather or friends available (e.g., "Is it raining? Yes/No").
2. Write a program that checks a userâ€™s age and recommends a movie rating (e.g., PG, PG-13, R).
