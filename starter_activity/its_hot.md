# 🧪 Starter Activity: Heat Alert! ☀️🥵

## 💬 Context:
It's getting hot outside! Too much heat can be dangerous, especially for **elderly people**.  
Let’s write a **function** that takes the **temperature** as input and returns a **message** to help keep people safe.

We'll use **emojis** to make the message friendly and easy to understand.

---

## 💡 What you’ll do:
Write a **function** that:
- Takes in a number (temperature in °C)
- Returns different messages depending on how hot it is

---

## 🤖 Pseudocode (step-by-step plan)

```
DEFINE a function called heat_alert that takes one input: temperature

IF temperature is less than 25:
    RETURN "😊 All good! Stay hydrated 💧"

ELSE IF temperature is between 25 and 30:
    RETURN "😅 Getting warm! Drink water and rest in shade 🧃⛱️"

ELSE IF temperature is between 30 and 35:
    RETURN "🥵 It's hot! Avoid direct sun and check on elderly ☎️👵"

ELSE:
    RETURN "🚨 Extreme heat warning! Stay indoors, drink water 💦🏠🧊"
```

## 🧠 Questions to Discuss:
- Why might heat be dangerous for older people?
- How can technology (like this function) help keep people safe?
- Could we connect this to a real sensor or a micro:bit?
