#python has different data types that can serve different puporses
'''Some of the common data types are whole numbers which (also know as intergers)
decimals are known as floats, as string of characters e.g 'bike', '42hudfh9' are
know as strings and True/False statements are known as boolean data types
'''

'''here is a brief demo showcasing the assignment of the  data types 6
listed above into a variable'''


#string
fruit = "apple"
dessert = 'cake'

#Notice that two different types of quotes were when assign this string variable
#the string is the only data type that requires quotes when assigning it.

#integer
num1 =12

#float
num2 =13.34

#boolean
state1=True
state2=False

# if you are not sure of a data type you always use the type() function and print
#your answer

print(type(num1))

#Chanlenge what data type will num3 below be?

num3 = num1 + num2
