# Python has different ways of storing data, known as data types that can serve different purposes
'''
Some of the common data types are:
- Whole numbers which called integers in Python.
- Decimals/Fractions which are known as floats or reals.
- Strings of characters, or text. e.g 'bike', '42hudfh9'
- True/False statements are known as Booleans

Here is a brief demo showcasing the assignment of the 4 data types
listed above into a variable
'''

# string
fruit = "apple"
dessert = 'cake'

# Notice that two different types of quotes were used when assigning these string variables
# The string is the only data type that requires quotes when assigning it.

# integer
num1 = 12

# float
num2 = 13.34

# boolean
state1 = True
state2 = False

# If you are not sure of a data type you can always use the type() function. Pass this into a print() to see the variable's data type
#your answer

datatype = type(num1)
print(datatype)

print(type(num1))

# Challenge: what data type will num3 below be?
num1 = 4
num2 = 7
num3 = num1 + num2

# Extend: What data type will num3 be if num1 or num2 were floats?
