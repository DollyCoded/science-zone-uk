# Lesson 5 - Calculator

Skills learnt:
- if statements, selection
- how to build a simple application and run from the command line.

In this lesson ninjas will put together what they've learnt into a command-line calculator application. They will print a menu asking which operation they want the user to perform. From there it will ask for two integer (or float) inputs and then perform the operation. Feel free to let students be creative in this project, as always.
