userInput = input("Enter anything here: ")
print(userInput)

# user input will always be a string. You need to cast this to other data types if you want to use it.

integer = input("Enter a whole number: ")
integer = int(integer)
print(integer + 10)

# You'll  notice that if you enter something that isn't a whole number into the above code, it will crash. We will learn how to deal with this later.
