# Sense HAT Color Selector

This project is designed to help kids learn coding concepts step-by-step while creating a fun and interactive program for the Sense HAT on a Raspberry Pi. By the end of this guide, students will have a program where users can select a color from the console and display it on the LED matrix.

---

## **What Youâ€™ll Learn**
- **Basic Python Concepts**: How to use variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.
- **Interacting with Hardware**: How to control the Sense HATâ€™s LED matrix.
- **User Input**: Letting the user choose options and responding to their choices.

---

## **How to Use**
1. Follow the steps below to build the program incrementally.
2. Copy and paste the code snippets into your Raspberry Piâ€™s Python editor (e.g., Thonny).
3. Test each step to see how it works before moving to the next.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Sense HAT**
The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi with an 8x8 LED matrix, sensors, and a joystick.

Start by writing the following code to set up the Sense HAT in Python:

**Code:**
```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat

# Initialize the Sense HAT
sense = SenseHat()
```

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**
- `from sense_hat import SenseHat`: This imports the Sense HAT library, which allows us to control the hardware.
- `sense = SenseHat()`: This creates a `sense` object, which weâ€™ll use to interact with the Sense HAT.

**Test It:**
Run the code. If there are no errors, the Sense HAT is ready to use!

---

### **Step 2: Turn Off the LED Matrix**
Before displaying anything, letâ€™s make sure the LED matrix is clear.

**Code:**
```python
# Turn off the LED matrix
sense.clear()
```

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**
- `sense.clear()`: This turns off all the LEDs on the Sense HAT.

**Test It:**
Run the code. The LED matrix should go blank.

---

### **Step 3: Display a Color**
Letâ€™s display a solid color on the LED matrix. Weâ€™ll start with red.

**Code:**
```python
# Display a solid red color
sense.clear((255, 0, 0))
```

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**
- `sense.clear((255, 0, 0))`: This lights up the LED matrix with the color red. The numbers `(255, 0, 0)` represent the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color values.

**Test It:**
Run the code. The LED matrix should turn red.

---

### **Step 4: Add a Dictionary of Colors**
A dictionary lets us store multiple colors in one place. This will make it easy to let users pick from several options.

**Code:**
```python
# Define RGB values for colors
color_options = {
    "1": (255, 0, 0),   # Red
    "2": (0, 255, 0),   # Green
    "3": (0, 0, 255),   # Blue
    "4": (255, 255, 0), # Yellow
    "5": (128, 0, 128), # Purple
    "6": (255, 255, 255) # White
}
```

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**
- `color_options`: This is a dictionary where each key (e.g., `"1"`) represents a color, and the value (e.g., `(255, 0, 0)`) is the RGB color code.

---

### **Step 5: Ask the User to Pick a Color**
Weâ€™ll use `input()` to let the user pick a color.

**Code:**
```python
# Ask the user for a color
print("Choose a color:")
print("1. Red")
print("2. Green")
print("3. Blue")
print("4. Yellow")
print("5. Purple")
print("6. White")

choice = input("Enter the number of your choice: ")
```

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**
- `input()`: This asks the user to type something into the console. Whatever they type is stored in the variable `choice`.

---

### **Step 6: Use Conditionals to Respond to the User**
Conditionals let the program decide what to do based on the userâ€™s input.

**Code:**
```python
# Check the user's choice and display the corresponding color
if choice in color_options:
    selected_color = color_options[choice]
    sense.clear(selected_color)
    print(f"Displayed color: {selected_color}")
else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**
- `if choice in color_options`: This checks if the userâ€™s input is one of the keys in the dictionary.
- `sense.clear(selected_color)`: Lights up the LED matrix with the chosen color.
- `else`: If the user enters something invalid, they get an error message.

---

### **Step 7: Add a Loop**
Letâ€™s make the program run continuously so the user can pick multiple colors.

**Code:**
```python
while True:
    print("\nChoose a color to display:")
    print("1. Red")
    print("2. Green")
    print("3. Blue")
    print("4. Yellow")
    print("5. Purple")
    print("6. White")
    print("Type 'exit' to quit.")

    choice = input("Enter the number of your choice: ")
    
    if choice.lower() == "exit":
        sense.clear()  # Turn off the LED matrix
        print("Exiting the program.")
        break
    elif choice in color_options:
        selected_color = color_options[choice]
        sense.clear(selected_color)
        print(f"Displayed color: {selected_color}")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**
- `while True`: This creates a loop that keeps running until the user types `"exit"`.
- `break`: This exits the loop and ends the program.
- `choice.lower() == "exit"`: Converts the userâ€™s input to lowercase and checks if itâ€™s `"exit"`.

---

## **Final Program**
Hereâ€™s the complete program:

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat

# Initialize the Sense HAT
sense = SenseHat()

# Define RGB values for the colors
color_options = {
    "1": (255, 0, 0),   # Red
    "2": (0, 255, 0),   # Green
    "3": (0, 0, 255),   # Blue
    "4": (255, 255, 0), # Yellow
    "5": (128, 0, 128), # Purple
    "6": (255, 255, 255) # White
}

# Main loop to handle user input
while True:
    print("\nChoose a color to display:")
    print("1. Red")
    print("2. Green")
    print("3. Blue")
    print("4. Yellow")
    print("5. Purple")
    print("6. White")
    print("Type 'exit' to quit.")

    choice = input("Enter the number of your choice: ")
    
    if choice.lower() == "exit":
        sense.clear()  # Turn off the LED matrix
        print("Exiting the program.")
        break
    elif choice in color_options:
        selected_color = color_options[choice]
        sense.clear(selected_color)
        print(f"Displayed color: {selected_color}")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

---

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**
- Add more colors to the `color_options` dictionary.
- Let the user define custom colors by typing in RGB values.
- Explore other Sense HAT features, like the joystick or sensors.
