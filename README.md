# The Science Zone UK

Welcome to the Science Zone UK! This repository will be used as a place where students can learn how to code in various languages and situations, guided by our Code Senseis. Students can also upload their code to this repository, provided they have a GitHub account using pull requests. Senseis have their own accounts and are collaborators on the repository, so they can edit it freely.
