# 🪎 Micro-Bit Workshop : Treasure Hunt

# 👋 Welcome!
Ahoy, young coder! Ready to turn your Micro:bit into a real-life treasure detector?

In this workshop, you'll create your very own Treasure Hunt game using MicroPython and two Micro:bits. You’ll use radio signals, compass directions, and some clever coding to help players track down hidden treasure. It’s exciting, a bit mysterious, and seriously rewarding when it all comes together!

# 🧠 Objectives

- You will be able to recall key MicroPython functions such as `display.scroll()`, `radio.send()`, and `compass.heading()`.
- You will be able to explain how radio signals and compass readings are used to detect proximity in the treasure hunt game.
- You will be able to write MicroPython code that uses the radio and compass to guide users in the game.
- You will be able to compare signal strength values and analyse how these affect LED brightness on the receiver.
- You will be able to assess the effectiveness of their radar design and suggest ways to improve feedback to the user.
- You will be able to develop a fully working treasure hunt game using two micro:bits and MicroPython code.

# 🗺️ Why Treasure Hunt?
Treasure Hunt is a great game to build because:

It’s simple just two Micro:bits and a bit of Python magic.

It teaches you how radio signals and compass readings work.

You’ll see your code come alive as the Micro:bit becomes a real tracker!

It’s super fun and you can customise it with sounds, lights, or challenges!

# 💻 Get Set Up
