Welcome to the Microbit course!
Here you will be learning to make some really fun projects using the BBC Microbit!
To send code to your microbit you need to connect to the Microbit Makecode editor.
Here is a link to access it: https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor

Firstly, we will be working with the LED on the microbit. The microbit has a number of LED lights on its front. 
You will be displaying some numbers and text using these LEDs.

#how to show a string

#it is important to know that a string is just a series of characters
basic.show_string("hgdghu34343343")
#the value above is still a considered to be a string
