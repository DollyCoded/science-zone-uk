## 🧠 PROMPT TO GENERATE FUTURE WORKSHOPS

> Create a 1.5-hour MicroPython workshop for [age group] using the Micro:bit and the microbit python library. The theme should be **[insert topic here]**. 
> The objectives are: [insert objective] [insert objective] [insert objective] [insert objective]
> - Start with a discussion on why the topic is important.
> - List all the coding concepts
> - Introduce the problem and requirements for the project.
> - Python editor here: https://python.microbit.org/v/3
> - Microbit help and api here https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/v2-docs/index.html
> - Start with a warm up, basic - just print 'Hello World' , medium - also display on led matrix, Hard - Use a loop to countdown then display 'Hello World'
> - Provide step-by-step activities with testable code.# 📝 MicroPython Workshop Planning Worksheet  
**For Coding Teachers – Designing with Intentional Learning Objectives**

## 📌 Step 1: Define Your Workshop

**Age group:** ____________________________________________  
**Theme or topic:** _________________________________________  
(e.g., sensors, games, environment, storytelling, safety alert system)

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Write Learning Objectives (Use Bloom’s Taxonomy)

Use one verb from each of the Bloom’s levels. Pick at least 4 objectives for your session.

| Bloom’s Level    | Learning Objective |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 🔵 Remembering    | Pupils will be able to… ____________________________ |
| 🟢 Understanding  | Pupils will be able to… ____________________________ |
| 🟡 Applying       | Pupils will be able to… ____________________________ |
| 🟠 Analysing      | Pupils will be able to… ____________________________ |
| 🔴 Evaluating     | Pupils will be able to… ____________________________ |
| 🟣 Creating        | Pupils will be able to… ____________________________ |

_Tip: Use verbs like_ *define, describe, compare, use, test, justify, create, design*.

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Identify Coding Concepts Used

List all programming concepts pupils will learn:
- ____________________________________________
- ____________________________________________
- ____________________________________________

_Examples: `print()`, `display.scroll()`, variables, loops, conditionals, `button_a.was_pressed()`, functions, input/output, etc._

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Break Down the Workshop Structure

### ✅ Warm-up Challenge  
Use 3 levels of difficulty:

| Level  | Task idea | Done? |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Basic  | Print “Hello World” | ☐ |
| Medium | Show message on LED | ☐ |
| Hard   | Use loop to countdown, then display “Hello World” | ☐ |

---

### 📐 Project Challenge (Main Task)  
**What is the main problem they will solve?**  
_________________________________________________________________  
**What are the constraints or success criteria?**  
_________________________________________________________________

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Step-by-Step Activity Breakdown  
Use the table to scaffold your session. Each row is one concept.

| Step | Concept (e.g., loop) | Code Snippet (easy version) | Pseudocode for advanced students | Notes / Questions to ask |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1    |                      |                             |                                  |                           |
| 2    |                      |                             |                                  |                           |
| 3    |                      |                             |                                  |                           |
| 4    |                      |                             |                                  |                           |

## 🚀 Step 6: Challenge & Remix

Design a creative task that encourages deeper thinking or invention:  
_________________________________________________________________  
_________________________________________________________________

---

## 💬 Step 7: Reflection Questions

Plan at least 2 prompts for pupils to reflect or discuss:
1. ____________________________________________________________  
2. ____________________________________________________________

---

## ✅ Final Checklist for Your Plan

- ☐ Objectives match activities  
- ☐ Clear progression of difficulty  
- ☐ Warm-up and challenge tasks are included  
- ☐ Scaffolding supports all levels  
- ☐ Opportunities for discussion or reflection
 the code will work
> - All programming concepts identified in the list above need to be broken up into codable snippets to fully test and build concept, use the context of the workshop to explain.
> - Use clear, engaging language appropriate for children aged [insert age].
> - Include challenge and reflection sections.
> 
> Each code step should have:
> - A short explanation
> - Code testing snippets of the concept, one or two lines of basic code, well commented.
> - Two choices of scaffolding, an easier copy paste cleanly formatted Python code snipppets that are well commented, each snippet is only one programming expression at a time. For more experienced coders provide psuedocode scaffolding then they write their own code.
> - Always Cleanly format Python code with lots of comments

## 🧠 PROMPT TO GENERATE FUTURE TEACHER HELP SHEETS

> Create a **Teacher Help Sheet** in Markdown format to accompany a Micro:bit workshop titled **"[Workshop Title]"**.  
> The lesson is for **[age]** and lasts **[duration]**.  
> Include:
> - Overview with age, duration, and learning goals  
> - Setup checklist and editor guidance  
> - MicroPython cheat sheet for teachers  
> - Troubleshooting section  
> - Common pitfalls and solutions  
> - Key vocabulary definitions  
> - Step-by-step guidance with tips for each student activity  
> - Teaching tips to support confidence  
> - Final completed program for teacher reference  
> Use the same tone, style, and formatting as the “Star Counter Adventure” help sheet.
