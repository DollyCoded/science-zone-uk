## 🧠 PROMPT TO GENERATE FUTURE WORKSHOPS

> Create a 1.5-hour MicroPython workshop for [age group] using the Micro:bit. The theme should be **[insert topic here]**. It must follow the same structure and tone as the “Star Counter Adventure” workshop:
> 
> - Start with a discussion on why the topic is important.
> - List all the coding concepts
> - Introduce the problem and requirements for the project.
> - Python editor here: https://python.microbit.org/v/3
> - Microbit help and api here https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/v2-docs/index.html
> - Provide step-by-step activities with testable code.
> - Step by step secions to include psuedocode and questions about how the code will work
> - All programming concepts identified in the list above need to be broken up into codable snippets to fully test and build concept, use the context of the workshop to explain.
> - Use clear, engaging language appropriate for children aged [insert age].
> - Include challenge and reflection sections.
> 
> Each code step should have:
> - A short explanation
> - Two choices use psuedocode to write your own code snippet or an easier copy paste cleanly formatted Python code blocks
> - Cleanly formatted Python code blocks
> - Testing instructions
