## 🧠 PROMPT TO GENERATE FUTURE WORKSHOPS

> Create a 1.5-hour MicroPython workshop for [age group] using the Micro:bit. The theme should be **[insert topic here]**. 
> The objectives are: [insert objective] [insert objective] [insert objective] [insert objective]
> - Start with a discussion on why the topic is important.
> - List all the coding concepts
> - Introduce the problem and requirements for the project.
> - Python editor here: https://python.microbit.org/v/3
> - Microbit help and api here https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/v2-docs/index.html
> - Start with a warm up, basic - just print 'Hello World' , medium - also display on led matrix, Hard - Use a loop to countdown then display 'Hello World'
> - Provide step-by-step activities with testable code.
> - Step by step secions to include psuedocode and questions about how the code will work
> - All programming concepts identified in the list above need to be broken up into codable snippets to fully test and build concept, use the context of the workshop to explain.
> - Use clear, engaging language appropriate for children aged [insert age].
> - Include challenge and reflection sections.
> 
> Each code step should have:
> - A short explanation
> - Code testing snippets of the concept, one or two lines of basic code, well commented.
> - Two choices of scaffolding, an easier copy paste cleanly formatted Python code snipppets that are well commented, each snippet is only one programming expression at a time. For more experienced coders provide psuedocode scaffolding then they write their own code.
> - Always Cleanly format Python code with lots of comments

## 🧠 PROMPT TO GENERATE FUTURE TEACHER HELP SHEETS

> Create a **Teacher Help Sheet** in Markdown format to accompany a Micro:bit workshop titled **"[Workshop Title]"**.  
> The lesson is for **[age]** and lasts **[duration]**.  
> Include:
> - Overview with age, duration, and learning goals  
> - Setup checklist and editor guidance  
> - MicroPython cheat sheet for teachers  
> - Troubleshooting section  
> - Common pitfalls and solutions  
> - Key vocabulary definitions  
> - Step-by-step guidance with tips for each student activity  
> - Teaching tips to support confidence  
> - Final completed program for teacher reference  
> Use the same tone, style, and formatting as the “Star Counter Adventure” help sheet.
